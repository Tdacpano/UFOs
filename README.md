# UFOs
# Overview of the analysis:
 The purpose of this analysis was to test our JavaScript knowledge by building a webpage using HTML and Bootstrap components. We built a table from UFO sighting data stored within a JavaScript array, and then added filters to make our table dynamic based off user input. These filters were based on date, city, state, country, and shape of the sighting. 

# Results:
   The first step was to insert the data from the data.js file into the table, row by row by using a forEach loop. Once we looped our data into our table we used "if" statements to build our filtered table. Once we built the filtered table we used another aspect of D3.js that can listen for events that occur on a webpage, such as a "click". To finalize our origial table we used the buildTable function to create a basic table filled with row upon row of unfiltered data pulled straight from our array. 
   The next step was to build our HTML file using bootstrap components along with making our webpage look more customized. We began the set up by adding a link to Bootstrap's content delivery network (CDN) and adding a link to our stylesheet under the link to Bootstrap's CDN. Once we had it linked we then built the Navbar, Jumbotron, Article Title, and Paragraph. Once we had the Bootstrap components set up, we created the table filter to connect our JavaScript and prepped the table for data. The next step was to add the data into the table on our webpage. Once we had the data set, the last step was to customize our style.ccs file. We added a dark grey theme along with a url to an image we wanted add the top of the page.
   To create multiple filters we began witin our app.js file, by creating a function to save the element, value and id of the filter that was changed that coorelated to our HTML file. We then created a new function to loop through the dataset and keep only the results that match the search criteria. 
   In order to test our new filters we simply add a date, city, state, country, or shape. For example, lets say we need to find data that appears on the 1/1/2010, in El Cajon CA, US, with a triangle shape. The photos below give step by step how to search on the webpage.

# Summary:
  To summarize we created a dynamic table within our webpage to filter through UFO data based on date, city, state, country, and shape. One drawback of the webpage is that we do not have a search filter based on keywords that individuals could look up if interested. Some possible recommendations could be to add some links to videos or more information on UFOs with the extra space we have on the webpage that can make it even more interactive. Additonally, capitalizing the city, state, and country names could make the webpage look more appealing.
